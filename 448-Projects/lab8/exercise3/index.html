        Howard Phillips Lovecraft was an American writer of weird and horror fiction,
        who is known for his creation of what became the Cthulhu Mythos.
        Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Lovecraft spent most of his life in New England.
        He was born into affluence, but his family's wealth dissipated soon after the death of his grandfather.
        In 1913, he wrote a critical letter to a pulp magazine that ultimately led to his involvement in pulp fiction.
        During the interwar period, he wrote and published stories that focused on his interpretation of humanity's
        place
        in the universe. In his view, humanity was an unimportant part of an uncaring cosmos that could be
        swept away at any moment. These stories also included fantastic elements that represented the
        perceived fragility of anthropocentrism.
        Lovecraft was at the center of a wider body of authors known as "The Lovecraft Circle".
        This group wrote stories that frequently shared details among them. He was also a prolific letter writer.
        He maintained a correspondence with several different authors and literary proteges. According to some
        estimates,
        he wrote approximately 100,000 letters over the course of his life. In these letters,
        he discussed his worldview and his daily life, and tutored younger authors, such as
        August Derleth, Donald Wandrei, and Robert Bloch.
